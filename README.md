# dynamic-habitat-prioritization
This repository hosts code and data of the nature-based solution manuscript
## code
* feature_preparation_priotizr.R used to generate multiple benefit features including avian biodiversity. water conservation, and carbo sequestration
* month_temporal_priorizr.P for temporal and spatial joint optimization 
* static_habitat for prioritization of static habitat based on conservation features

## data
* birds features are abundance of birds generated using species distribution models
* pland_** are land use change scenarios used to calculate carbon sequestion potentials and grounwater recharge suitabilities
* carSeq_**.tif are calculated carbon sequestions potential increase by scenarios
